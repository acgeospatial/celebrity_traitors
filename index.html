    <h3>Prelude</h3>
    <p>
      Nick Mohammed is the bookies favourite to win at 7/4, meaning he'll be the first one murdered.
      Seems almost inevitable that Alan Carr will be a traitor, Lucy Beaumont will lose her mind with the wildest theories
      and ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt trust them ‚Äì they are an actor‚Äù will be said in every episode.
      Will they arrive by train? Will the first task involve setting fire to something big while Claudia screams ‚Äúcome on‚Ä¶ hurry up‚Äù?
      Assuming that Charlotte Church* isn‚Äôt going to pretend to be Scottish and that Tom Daley isn‚Äôt Kate Garraway‚Äôs son,
      where is the twist coming from this time? Perhaps Little Mix can hide in the castle handing out protective shields
      to those who recognise them**.
      Claire Balding and Jonathan Ross will spend the first episode persuading everyone that there will be
      less than three or more than three traitors this time ‚Äì even though Claudia always picks three.
      Inevitably the winner will be someone we have never heard of before.
      Let the magic and insanity of the roundtable begin!

  <h3>Episode 1 of 9 - 8th October - 'look Clare a horse'</h3>
  <p>Ed Gamble chiseling the grave stone! Nick digs Celia's grave, Celia immediately gets suspicious. While we miss out on Celia and Joe Marler being traitors,
  we get Jonathan, Cat and Alan. Alan immediately starts sweating and behaving weirdly, thus cementing his status as all time
  traitor legend. They push a wooden trojan horse up a hill through 4 locked gates. At the first gate Clare pulls a 'Balding' as she pulls a lever
  locking the gate. Charlotte gives up her shield and suspicion turns on them both. Nick guides them through the remaining gates with his genius. 
  Back in castle the traitors are told to murder in plain sight, by rubbing hands on a black lilly and then touching someone's face.<br>
  Will Alan touch his own face? (he did seem to get quite a bit of pollen on his hands)<br>
  Ruth making a tray of marshmallows come back on her when the faithful realise someone was murdered in plain sight?<br>
  Jonathan forgetting he had a shield when speaking to Joe M<br>
  Ruth and Niko pact<br>
  Jonathan and Alan saying see you in the tower<br>
  Alan unable to whisper<br>

  <p><img src="images/alan-carr.jpg" alt="Alan Carr"></p>
  <p>Suspicious: Clare, Charlotte <br>
  Under the radar: David, Lucy, Mark <br>
  Safe: Stephen, Cat, Joe M, Joe W<br>
  Playing a different game: Alan
  </p>
  <p class="footnotes">
    Murdered: no one - Banished: no one - Shields: Jonathan, Joe M, Joe W, Celia, <s>Charlotte</s> (gave it up) <br>
  </p>

<div class="prelude">
  <h3>Episode 2 of 9 - 9th October - 'Flabbergasted Daylee'</h3>
  <p>Alan hones his hands in on Ruth and Paloma in the kitchen. The traitors discuss in the tower - Alan reveals he killed Paloma. Its a slow death
    so at breakfast everyone is still present - queue some dramatic over acting (see Kate). They attend the funeral cortege of (the still unawre) Paloma.
    Tom becomes the first person in history to attend a funeral with his shirt completely open, as he competes with Charlotte for the traitors most
    clevage exposed award 2025. Three coffins await the gang, Claudia gives spurious clues as to who they belong to. We end up with Niko, 
    Lucy & Paloma 'lying in state'. The celebrities guess, wrongly, Lucy is the one choosen by the traitors. Claudia shuts Paloma's coffin lid and hence is murdered. 
    Jonathan asks Alan to say a few words, Alan stutters, sweats and almost confesses. Jonathan playing it cool.<br>
    At the roundtable Stephen annonuces that Sherlock Holmes said once 'it is a cardinal error to theorise without data', as everyone
    then theorises without data, including himself as he goes for Niko. Tom seems to have his foot on Kate's neck, and Mark identifies
    Tameka as suspicious - she isn't happy about that. Clare does a 'Balding' again by identifying Alan as a good choice for a traitor and proceeds
    to not mention it, Joe M appears to have missed Jonathan's shield slip. Joe W, having previously calling himself a sheep, turns his 
    guns on Tom, while defending Niko.<br>
    The vote begins and as Stephen is asked to vote the episode ends, 9 votes remain it could be anyone.<br>
