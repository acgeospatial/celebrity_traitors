    <h3>Prelude</h3>
    <p>
      Nick Mohammed is the bookies favourite to win at 7/4, meaning he'll be the first one murdered.
      Seems almost inevitable that Alan Carr will be a traitor, Lucy Beaumont will lose her mind with the wildest theories
      and ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt trust them ‚Äì they are an actor‚Äù will be said in every episode.
      Will they arrive by train? Will the first task involve setting fire to something big while Claudia screams ‚Äúcome on‚Ä¶ hurry up‚Äù?
      Assuming that Charlotte Church* isn‚Äôt going to pretend to be Scottish and that Tom Daley isn‚Äôt Kate Garraway‚Äôs son,
      where is the twist coming from this time? Perhaps Little Mix can hide in the castle handing out protective shields
      to those who recognise them**.
      Clare Balding and Jonathan Ross will spend the first episode persuading everyone that there will be
      less than three or more than three traitors this time ‚Äì even though Claudia always picks three.
      Inevitably the winner will be someone we have never heard of before.
      Let the magic and insanity of the roundtable begin!

  <h3>Episode 1 of 9 - 8th October - 'look Clare a horse'</h3>
  <p>Ed Gamble chiselling the grave stone! Nick digs Celia's grave, Celia immediately gets suspicious. While we miss out on Celia and Joe Marler being traitors,
  we get Jonathan, Cat and Alan. Alan immediately starts sweating and behaving weirdly, thus cementing his status as all time
  traitor legend. They push a wooden trojan horse up a hill through 4 locked gates. At the first gate Clare pulls a 'Balding' as she pulls a lever
  locking the gate. Charlotte gives up her shield and suspicion turns on them both. Nick guides them through the remaining gates with his genius. 
  Back in castle the traitors are told to murder in plain sight, by rubbing hands on a black lilly and then touching someone's face.<br>
  Will Alan touch his own face? (he did seem to get quite a bit of pollen on his hands)<br>
  Ruth making a tray of marshmallows come back on her when the faithful realise someone was murdered in plain sight?<br>
  Jonathan forgetting he had a shield when speaking to Joe M<br>
  Ruth and Niko pact<br>
  Jonathan and Alan saying see you in the tower<br>
  Alan unable to whisper<br>
  </p>
  <p><img src="images/alan-carr.jpg" alt="Alan Carr"></p>
  <p>Suspicious: Clare, Charlotte <br>
  Under the radar: David, Lucy, Mark <br>
  Safe: Stephen, Cat, Joe M, Joe W<br>
  Playing a different game: Alan
  </p>
  <p class="footnotes">
    Murdered: no one - Banished: no one - Shields: Jonathan, Joe M, Joe W, Celia, <s>Charlotte</s> (gave it up) <br>
    Prize Pot = ¬£15,000
  </p>
</div>
<div class="prelude">
  <h3>Episode 2 of 9 - 9th October - 'Flabbergasted Daylee'</h3>
  <p>Alan hones his hands in on Ruth and Paloma in the kitchen. The traitors discuss what happened in the tower - Alan reveals he killed Paloma. Its a slow death
    so at breakfast everyone is still present - queue some dramatic over acting (see Kate). They attend the funeral cortege of (the still unawre) Paloma.
    Tom becomes the first person in history to attend a funeral with his shirt completely open, as he competes with Charlotte for the 'traitors most
    clevage exposed' award 2025. Three coffins await the gang; Claudia gives spurious clues as to who they belong to. We end up with Niko, 
    Lucy & Paloma 'lying in state', Lucy is ok as she has previous 'slept in a wheelie bin'. The celebrities guess, wrongly, that Lucy was the one choosen by the traitors. Claudia shuts Paloma's coffin lid and hence is murdered. 
    Jonathan asks Alan to say a few words, Alan stutters, sweats and almost confesses. Jonathan plays it cool.<br>
    At the roundtable Stephen annonuces that Sherlock Holmes said once 'it is a cardinal error to theorise without data', as everyone
    then theorises without data, including himself - as he goes for Niko. Tom seems to have his foot on Kate's neck, and Mark identifies
    Tameka as suspicious - she isn't happy about that. Clare does a 'Balding' again by identifying Alan as a good choice for a traitor and proceeds
    to not mention it. Joe M appears to have missed Jonathan's shield slip in episode 1. Joe W, having previously calling himself a sheep, turns his 
    guns on Tom, while defending Niko.<br>
    The vote begins and as Stephen is asked to vote the episode ends. 9 votes remain it - it could be anyone.<br>
  </p>
  <p><img src="images/tom.jpeg" alt="Tom Daylee", width="400" height="250"></p>
  <p>Suspicious: Niko, Kate, Tameka, Tom <br>
  Under the radar: David, Lucy, Mark, Jonathan <br>
  Safe: Stephen, Cat, Joe M, Joe W, Ruth<br>
  Playing a different game: Alan
  </p>
  <p class="footnotes">
    Murdered: Paloma - Banished: tbd - Shield(s): None<br>
    3 votes for Niko, 3 votes for Kate, 2 for Tameka, 1 for Tom<br>
    9 votes as yet unseen
    Prize Pot = ¬£19,500
  </p>
</div>
<div class="prelude">
  <h3>Episode 3 of 9 - 15th October - Big Dog Theory</h3>
  <p>Stephen votes for Niko and anticlimactically 7 votes also go his way, cue much guilt from the players. The traitors meet 
    they decide between Clare 'so it gets pinned on Kate', Tom 'massively perceptive Daylee' or 'completely out of leftfield' Joe W. Tom has
    a shower, he doesn't seem to mind being filmed - tick off your Bingo Card. At the continental breakfast Tom doesn't return. He didn't take the news well,
    Claudia drops his picture on the floor and Jonathan wears a carpet. Ruth has all guns pointed at Jonathan who has broken their alliance
    'don't piss in my ear and tell me its raining', she is mad determined now as is Clare. <br>
    On the way to the task, the cars are stopped by golden masked figures who escort them to the creepy cabin. The players are locked to
    a central point. Celia lets one go; Claudia struggles to keep it together. They basically have 15mins to unlock themselves, the keys
    are outside. While the game begins the remaining players are showered in water; Tameka fears drowning, sparks fly from fuse boards; 
    screaming from Kate and feathers (chicken?) are blown in causing Alan to dry heave. They complete the task, Mark and Clare dig through
    troughs of mud to find shields and they bank all the money. <br>
    Mark still thinks Tameka and Tameka thinks Mark. Celia openly snoops, the Joe's come up with the Big Dog theory (Faithful team Stephen,
    Traitor team Jonathan). Jonathan looks very vulnerable now. At the roundtable and Clare gives 'her who is the least likely to kill Paloma - its 
    Alan theory' and in the style of Doctor Who she regenerates from task blunderer into a cold-eyed traitor hunter. Joe M brings forward big dog theory
    and Joe W and Ruth both zoned in on Jonathan as cold eyed Clare goes in. <br>
    Voting is wild. Joe M 'its Jonathan, its Jonathan, its Jonathan' and then votes for Kate. In the end Tameka is banished with just 4 votes out of 17. 
    Mark is unhappy how wrong he is. Back in the tower the traitors narrow it down to Ruth, David or Charlotte. At the roundtable Jonathan voted
    for Ruth. <br> <br>
    Alan and Cat have agreed to throw Jonathan under the bus. Seems almost certain they'll murder Ruth and turn on the Big Dog. 
    Watch out for Clare, Jonathan!
    <br>
    Alan is now playing a blinder, when will Kate go?

  <h3>Episode 4 of 9 - 16th October - Yabadaba don't </h3>
  <p>'Clare appears very pleased to have a shield' observes Joe W. Clare has one thing on her mind only...'he said the word alliance'.
    Ruth is murdered; Jonathan plays his double bluff (Ruth suspects Jonathan on reading her letter) - 'Jonathan I think thats got you
    off the hook now' - as Joe W steps up. Jonathan points the guns at Clare, Clare points them back. Classic traitor response.<br><br>
    Team Big Dog hunters meet, Joe M thinks Jonathan, Joe W thinks Stephen - they reach no clear conclusion. Bad Badminton is played.<br>
    Task time and it basically involves one group screaming down a well after asking a banshee to let out their wail. The other group submerge theirs heads in a well of water
    to listen to the screams. Celia appears to have a breakdown on this task. They are to identify the matching scream with a name/heart thing.
    They get all bar 1 correct, the listeners get wet. Jonathan lets Stephen take the shield, Clare notices, Cat takes the other. Cat's group agree to
    keep the shield owner hidden. <br>
    At the roundtable attention is directed firstly to David, the 'you are quiet therefore you = traitor' theory. Celia is suspected by Nick. 
    Clare goes for Jonathan; Jonathan goes for Clare - the gang are influenced by Jonathan and seemingly go for Clare. Joe M isn't having it
    'you ARE a traitor Jonathan' - and votes for him. Clare up first and votes for... Charlotte! (did that discussion get edited?). The herd 
    moves big time and its towards Clare she gets 7 votes. Perhaps what did for her is her ability to be confidently incorrect so often
     that when she is spot on no one listens? Mark is properly annoyed. Kate is sheep like.
    Alan (the star of the show) and Cat are playing a brilliant game. In the tower they debate Charlotte, Kate and David. Feels like its Charlottes time. Jonathan is toast.
