    <h3>Prelude</h3>
    <p>
      Nick Mohammed is the bookies favourite to win at 7/4, meaning he'll be the first one murdered.
      Seems almost inevitable that Alan Carr will be a traitor, Lucy Beaumont will lose her mind with the wildest theories
      and ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt trust them ‚Äì they are an actor‚Äù will be said in every episode.
      Will they arrive by train? Will the first task involve setting fire to something big while Claudia screams ‚Äúcome on‚Ä¶ hurry up‚Äù?
      Assuming that Charlotte Church* isn‚Äôt going to pretend to be Scottish and that Tom Daley isn‚Äôt Kate Garraway‚Äôs son,
      where is the twist coming from this time? Perhaps Little Mix can hide in the castle handing out protective shields
      to those who recognise them**.
      Claire Balding and Jonathan Ross will spend the first episode persuading everyone that there will be
      less than three or more than three traitors this time ‚Äì even though Claudia always picks three.
      Inevitably the winner will be someone we have never heard of before.
      Let the magic and insanity of the roundtable begin!

  <h3>Episode 1 of 9 - 8th October - 'look Clare a horse'</h3>
  <p>Ed Gamble chiseling the grave stone! Nick digs Celia's grave, Celia immediately gets suspicious. We miss out on Celia and Joe Marler being traitors,
  we get Jonathan, Cat and Alan. Alan immediately starts sweating and behaving weirdly, thus cementing his status as all time
  traitor legend. The push a wooden trojan horse up a hill through 4 gates. At the first gate Clare pulls a 'Balding' as she pulls a lever
  locking the gate. Charlotte gives up her shield and suspicion turns on them both. Nick guides them through the remaining gates with his genius. 
  Back in castle the traitors are told to murder in plain sight, by rubbing hands on a black lilly and then touching someone's face.<br>
  <ul>
   <li>Will Alan touch his own face? (he did seem to get quite a bit of pollen on his hands)</li>
   <li>Will Ruth making a tray of marshmallows come back on her when the faithful realise someone was murdered in plain sight?</li>
   <li>Jonathan forgetting he had a shield when speaking to Joe M<li>
   <li>Ruth and Niko pact</li>
   <li>Jonathan and Alan saying see you in the tower</li>
   <li>Alan unable to whisper</li>
  </ul>
